## BUG-001 — Event deletion has no confirmation

| Field | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Severity | P2 MEDIUM |
| Feature | Events — Event CRUD |
| Role | Anonymous Squad Pro demo coach/staff |
| Page or route | `/events` |
| Description | The destructive event delete control executes immediately and offers no confirmation or cancel opportunity. |
| Expected behavior | Clicking delete opens a confirmation dialog that identifies the event; only explicit confirmation deletes it. Cancel leaves it unchanged. |
| Actual behavior | One click on `Delete QA Audit Practice` removed the event immediately. |
| Exact reproduction steps | 1. Launch Squad Pro demo. 2. Open `/events`. 3. Create `QA Audit Practice` with a valid future date/time. 4. Reload and open the event. 5. Click `Delete QA Audit Practice` once. |
| Reproduction consistency | 1/1; deterministic code path confirmed |
| Browser | Chromium, desktop |
| Console evidence | No application error; deletion silently succeeds |
| Network evidence | Create action returned HTTP 200; delete completed without an intervening confirmation state |
| Likely code area | `src/app/(dashboard)/events/EventDetailDialog.tsx:306` directly calls `onDelete(event.id)` from the button |
| Related features | Schedule, attendance, RSVP, reminders, calendar views |
| Artifacts | `output/playwright/2026-08-21T232919Z/root-demo/event-before-delete.yml`, `event-after-delete.yml`, `pro-demo.trace` |

## BUG-002 — Sports Hub header search collapses at tablet width

| Field | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Severity | P2 MEDIUM |
| Feature | Sports Hub — browse/search |
| Role | Visitor |
| Page or route | `/sports-hub` |
| Description | At 768×1024, the global Sports Hub header search shrinks to roughly 94 px and clips its placeholder to a single `S`. |
| Expected behavior | The primary search control remains visibly identifiable and usable at the representative tablet viewport. |
| Actual behavior | Fixed adjacent header actions compress the search until its text affordance is materially clipped. |
| Exact reproduction steps | 1. Open a fresh visitor session. 2. Resize to 768×1024. 3. Navigate to `/sports-hub`. 4. Inspect the header search control. |
| Reproduction consistency | 1/1 at 768×1024; wider desktop and mobile layouts did not show the same symptom |
| Browser | Chromium |
| Console evidence | 0 errors, 0 warnings |
| Network evidence | 0 unexpected failures; page and assets loaded successfully |
| Likely code area | `src/components/sports-hub/SportsHubClientLayout.tsx` search container and `SearchBar.tsx` |
| Related features | Sports Hub navigation, article/resource discovery, responsive header |
| Artifacts | `output/playwright/2026-08-21T232919Z/public-content/sports-hub-tablet-768x1024.png` and public-content trace |
| Status | OPEN |
